Ableton and Glover patches for Whatever Weighs You Down by Neil Luck and Zubin Kanga
These patched allow for the use of MiMU sensor gloves in Whatever Weighs You Down. The Glover patches connect to the Ableton session. Note that two sets of gloves and two scenes are used within the Glover patch, corresponding to the two main sections in which the gloves are used.
